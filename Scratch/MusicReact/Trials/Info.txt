TO DO
-------

Task - add in new octave
    1) octaves -> 8
    2) add eq8
    3) change A1-> 27
    4) change calcs...

Task - Test diff microphones
Task - data from wav file (play while processing)
Task - Ratchet buffer up a size 16k -> 32k, and perhaps the listening chunk 256 -> 512
Task - Show Processed (harmonics and such)
Task - Show colorbar if possible
Task - EQ Calculations to average between bands
    - Saving? (can have saving of control settings for diff music, etc)
    
    
# TODO controls for (octaves, A1, ...)
# TODO Save variables to singular storage
Task - Clean up py file organization


Debug - Get timings on diff fft levels (how long between octave refreshes)
Debug - Why NoteIntensities 4 always blank right now?
    - 4 is because of the resolution... need to go higher buffer size to get that resolution
