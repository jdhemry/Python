TO DO
-------
Display -> freq / value
Make display relative instead of const changing what colors mean
Put equalizer in place (poss make band eq controls to control) if it works well (can have saving of control settings for diff music, etc)
Get timings on diff fft levels (how long between octave refreshes)
Why are NoteIntensities 0 and 4 always blank right now?
    - 4 is because of the resolution... need to go higher buffer size to get that resolution
    - 0 is likely because of how I'm bucketing or finding the right bucket
Ratchet buffer up a size 16k -> 32k, and perhaps the listening chunk 256 -> 512
Try also having a maxOctave on the render... so that low level scans don't push agg data into the cell
    - then can change the window and see what gives the best results
